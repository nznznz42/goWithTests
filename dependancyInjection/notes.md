# chapter 8

- dependancy injection is a way to ensure seperation of concerns and loose coupling by writing code that is designed to accept its dependencies as an input rather than creating them internally
- it allows the following problems to be solved:
    1. making an object independant of the creation of its dependancies
    2. allow for rapid testing and refactoring
    3. allow for easy configurability
    4. changing the behaviour of a piece of code without editing it directly
