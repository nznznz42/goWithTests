- Generics allow developers to write functions and data structures that can work with different types without sacrificing type safety. This promotes code reusability by enabling the creation of flexible and generic algorithms that can be applied to various data types. Without generics, developers often resort to code duplication or using interface{} (empty interface), which can lead to less readable and more error-prone code.

- Generics can lead to better performance compared to using interface{} and type assertions. By allowing the compiler to generate specialized code for each type, generics remove the need for runtime type checking. This can result in faster and more optimized code.
