# chapter 12

- reflection is a technique for code to examine it's own or other codes structure at runtime
- refelection is handled differently in every language
- it allows for the passing of arbitrary objects into functions and the like
- it uses recursion to traverse arbitrary data structures
- the "reflect" package provides easy to use primitives to accomplish this
- this is a personal opinion but I cannot see why this would ever be useful or result in anything other than type unsafe code I hope I never have to use it
